### INTRODUCTION

The Boruvka (also known as Boruvka's) algorithm is a classical method in Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, weighted graph. Developed by Otakar Bor≈Øvka in 1926, this algorithm repeatedly adds the shortest edge from each component to a different component, thereby merging them until a single connected component is formed. The algorithm is efficient for parallel computation and lays the foundation for more advanced MST algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's.
<br><br><br>


### WORKING

1. Start with a graph G=(V,E) where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges. Initially, each vertex is considered as a separate component (tree).<br>
2. For each component, select the smallest weight edge that connects the component to any other component. <br>
3. Add all the selected edges to the MST and merge the connected components. If multiple edges are the same weight, choose any to break the tie. <br>
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there is only one component left, which will be the MST. <br>
5. The algorithm terminates when all vertices are part of a single component.
